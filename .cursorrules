# Coding Standards

## Core Principles

### 1. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Extract common logic into reusable functions/classes
- Create abstractions for repeated patterns
- No copy-paste code

### 2. SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: One class, one purpose
- **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Subclasses must be substitutable for base classes
- **Interface Segregation**: Specific interfaces over general ones
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### 3. KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- Simple solutions over complex ones
- Avoid over-engineering
- Readable code beats clever code

### 4. Law of Demeter
- Minimize knowledge between modules
- Only call methods of immediate friends
- Avoid chaining: `object.getA().getB().getC()`

### 5. Separation of Concerns
- Separate business logic from presentation
- Use layered architecture
- Each module addresses one concern

### 6. High Cohesion, Loose Coupling
- Group related functionality together
- Minimize dependencies between modules
- Use interfaces to decouple implementations

## Best Practices
- Clear naming conventions
- Small, focused functions (< 30 lines)
- Meaningful error messages
- Write testable code
- Document complex logic only
- Optimize based on profiling, not assumptions
