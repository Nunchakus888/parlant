<p> 
Parlant is an API that allows developers to quickly iterate on the behavior of their GenAI chat agents. 

It is ideal for situations where developers need to tune, iterate on and predictably control their AI agent's behavior.

## Why use Parlant? 

Building conversational AI agents is relatively simple for most developers â€” at least, it is relatively simple to build an initial protoype. 

But these prototypes are usually not production-ready. Once the prototype is functional, it has to be tuned so that it's behavior is actually provides customers with the experience they expect. 

Parlant makes it easy and fast for developers to adjust the AI agents' behavior based on feedback from customers and business stakeholders. 

### Instant feedback

Quickly change the guidelines, glossaries, context variables and API usage instructions, and the generation enginge will immediately apply the changes. 

### No breaking prompts

With prompt engineering, each change you make risks interacting with the existing agent's behavior in unpredictable ways, including breaking existing, tested behaviors. With Parlant, this risk is eliminated. 

### Predictable at scale

Prompt engineering also often ends up creating unpredictable AI agent behavior at scale. With Parlant, you can ensure the AI agent will behave consistently, regardless of the load.
