## Why use Parlant?
Building conversational AI agents is relatively simple for most developersâ€”at least, it's relatively simple to build an initial prototype.

But these prototypes are rarely ready to meet customers. Once the prototype is functional, it has to be continually tuned so that its behavior actually provides customers with a good experience that business stakeholders approve.

With DIY prompt-engineering, reliably incorporating feedback from stakeholders is challenging, as simple implementations tend to be fragile and inconsistent.

Parlant bridges this gap in a way that makes it easy and fast for developers to reliably adjust the behavior of AI agents based on feedback from customers and business stakeholders.

## Key benefits

### Control that actually works
* **Guidelines**: Control responses by writing contextual rules - like "offer limited time coupons if it's a holiday" or "make it very clear we don't offer loans if a customer asks about it". By using condition/action definitions, you define exactly when and how your agent should respond
* **Glossary**: Teach your agent your business-specific terminology so that both you and customers can speak to it naturally in your language
* **Coherence checks**: Catch conflicts by having Parlant evaluate new guidelines against existing ones before they're applied
* **Dynamic context**: Make your agent context-aware by setting user-specific variables like customer account or subscription tier. These shape how your agent responds to each user
* **Guided tool use**: Control API access by linking tools to specific guidelines. This way, your agent only calls APIs when appropriate and with clear intent

### Developer friendly
* **See changes instantly**: Modify behavior on the fly by updating guidelines directly, no retraining or redeployment needed
* **Track changes in Git**: Manage agent behavior like code by storing configuration as JSON in your repo. Review, rollback, branch, and merge just like any other code
* **Clean architecture**: Separate concerns by keeping business logic in tools and conversation patterns in guidelines. Each piece does what it does best
* **Type safety**: Build rapidly using native TypeScript/JavaScript SDKs with proper type definitions

### Deploy with confidence
* **Reliable at scale**: Parlant filters and selects guidelines per context, allowing you to scale your agent's complexity and use-cases while maintaining consistent, focused behavior
* **Debug with ease**: Troubleshoot effectively by tracing which guidelines were applied and why for any given response
* **Test before deploy**: Validate changes using the built-in chat UI to test new behaviors before they reach customers

## Real-world impact

[Revenued](https://www.revenued.com), A business capital provider, could get into trouble if their AI agents make false claims or make statements that imply discrimination in lending.

With Parlant, they've been able to quickly integrate feedback from customer service experts and then test and verify that the agents aren't making problematic promises or statements to customers.
