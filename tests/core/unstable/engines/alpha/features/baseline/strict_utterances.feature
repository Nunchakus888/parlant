        And an agent
        And that the agent uses the strict_utterance message composition mode
        And an empty session

        Given an agent whose job is to schedule veterinary appointments and provide pet care information
        And that the agent uses the strict_utterance message composition mode

        And a context variable "next_available_date" set to "May 22" for "Joanna"
        And a context variable "vet_name" set to "Dr. Happypaws" for "Joanna"
        And a context variable "clinic_address" set to "155 Pawprint Lane" for "Joanna"

        And a guideline to provide the next available appointment details when a customer requests a checkup for their pet
        And a customer message, "I need to schedule a routine checkup for my dog Max. He's a 5-year-old golden retriever."
        And an utterance, "Our next available appointment for {{generative.pet_name}} with {{generative.vet_name}} is on the {{generative.appointment_date}} at our clinic located at {{generative.clinic_address}}. For a {{generative.pet_age}}-year-old {{generative.pet_breed}}, we recommend {{generative.recommended_services}}."

        And an utterance, "Would you prefer a morning or afternoon appointment?"
        And an utterance, "Our next available appointment is next Tuesday. Does that work for you?"
